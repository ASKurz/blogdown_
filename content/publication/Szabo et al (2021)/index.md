abstract: '**Objective:** Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common problem for veterans. Resilience, the tendency to bounce back from difficult circumstances, is negatively associated with posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) among individuals with a history of trauma, and thus it may be important to understand responses to trauma reminders. **Methods:** Using a quasi-experimental design, we examined the association between trait resilience and state PTCs in veterans with PTSD $(n = 47, M_\textit{age} = 48.60, 91.8\%$ male$)$ at two points: following a written trauma narrative exposure (Time 1 [T1]), and following a subsequent positive distraction task (i.e., brief, positive video) (T2). **Results:** After controlling for PTSD symptom severity and combat exposure, resilience was negatively associated with PTCs at T1 $(\Delta R^2 = .19)$ and T2 $(\Delta R^2 = .13)$. However, resilience was a poor predictor of change in PTCs from T1 to T2. We also examined the relationship between resilience and subtypes of PTCs: resilience was associated with negative views of the self $($T1, $\Delta R^2 = .24)$ but not negative views of the world or self-blame $($T1, $\Delta R^{2s} \leq .07)$; these results were consistent at T2. **Conclusions:** Thus, resilience may buffer against negative trauma-related cognitions after trauma recall. Future research could examine whether resilience-building exercises reduce negative PTCs after trauma reminders among veterans. Additional research is needed to generalize to other trauma-exposed populations.'
