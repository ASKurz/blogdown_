abstract: 'In their review of 160 articles in the *Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science* (*JCBS*), Newsome, Newsome, Fuller & Meyer (2019) argued prior *JCBS* authors have disproportionately relied on self-report measures to the neglect of more overt measures of behavior. I agree that increasing the frequency of more overt behavioral measures of behavior could potentially improve the quality of the scholarship within *JCBS*. To encourage these changes, we might consider a fuller analysis of the factors maintaining the status quo, and further discuss the practical ways we might reinforce the behaviors we desire among our fellow scientists. In this commentary, I offer several steps the leadership within *JCBS* and the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science (ACBS) might take to encourage these changes. With skillfully-applied positive reinforcement, we might use our science to improve our science.'

*Note*. In the original paper, I mistakenly forgot to include the focal article by Newsom and colleagues (2019) in the reference section. Though we eventually caught the mistake in the publishing process, I was told it was too late to correct the mistake. *Sigh*. You can find their original article at [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2018.11.005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2018.11.005).
