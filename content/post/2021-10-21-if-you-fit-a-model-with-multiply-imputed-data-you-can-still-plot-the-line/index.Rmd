## What?

If you're in the know, you know there are three major ways to handle missing data:

* full-information maximum likelihood,
* multiple imputation, and
* one-step full-luxury[^1] Bayesian imputation.

If you're a frequentist, you only have the first two options. If you're an **R** [@R-base] user and like multiple imputation, you probably know all about the **mice** package [@R-mice; @mice2011], which generally works great. The bummer is there are no built-in ways to plot the fitted lines from models fit from multiply-imputed data using van Buuren's **mice**-oriented workflow (see [GitHub issue #82](https://github.com/amices/mice/issues/82)). However, there is a way to plot your fitted lines by hand and in this blog post I'll show you how.

### I make assumptions.

For this post, I'm presuming some background knowledge:

* You should be familiar with regression. For frequentist introductions, I recommend Roback and Legler's [-@roback2021beyond] online text or James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani's [-@james2021AnIntroduction] online text. For Bayesian introductions, I recommend either edition of McElreath's text [-@mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2015; -@mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020]; Kruschke's [-@kruschkeDoingBayesianData2015] text; or Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari's [-@gelmanRegressionOtherStories2020] text.

* You should be familiar with contemporary missing data theory. You can find brief overviews in the texts by McElreath and Gelman et al, above. For a deeper dive, I recommend @enders2010applied, @little2019statistical, or @vanbuurenFlexibleImputationMissing2018. Also, heads up: [word on the street](https://twitter.com/AmandaKMontoya/status/1341936335301406722) is Enders is working on the second edition of his book.

* All code is in **R**. Data wrangling and plotting were done with help from the **tidyverse** [@R-tidyverse; @wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019] and **GGally** [@R-GGally]. The data and multiple-imputation workflow are from the [**mice** package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mice).

Here we load our primary **R** packages.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(mice)
```

### We need data.

In this post we'll focus on a subset of the `brandsma` data set [@brandsma1989effects]. The goal, here, is to take a small enough subset that there will be noticeable differences across the imputed data sets.

```{r}
set.seed(201)

b_small <-
  brandsma %>% 
  filter(!complete.cases(.)) %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 50) %>% 
  select(ses, iqv, iqp)

glimpse(b_small)
```

Here are our three variables.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
ggpairs(b_small)
```

We'll be focusing on the relation between socioeconomic status (`ses`) and verbal IQ (`iqv`) and performance IQ (`iqp`) will be a missing data covariate. 

Here's what the missing data patterns look like.

```{r}
b_small %>% 
  mutate_all(.funs = ~ ifelse(is.na(.), 0, 1)) %>% 
  count(ses, iqv, iqp, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = 100 * n / sum(n))
```

Here `1` means the value was observed and `0` means the value was missing. Twenty-eight percent of the cases have missingness on one of the two focal variables. The bulk of the missingness is in `ses`.

## Impute

We'll use the `mice()` function to impute. By setting `m = 10`, we'll get back 10 multiply-imputed data sets. By setting `method = "norm"`, we will be using Bayesian linear regression with the Gaussian likelihood to compute the imputed values.

```{r}
imp <- mice(b_small, seed = 540, m = 10, method = "norm", print = FALSE)
```

## Model

Our statistical model will be

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{iqv}_i & \sim \mathcal N(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{ses}_i.
\end{align*}
$$

With the `mice::with()` function, we fit that model once to each of the 10 imputed data sets.

```{r}
fit <- with(imp, lm(iqv ~ 1 + ses))
```

There's a lot of information packed into our `fit` object. Within the `analyses` section we can find the results of all 10 models.

```{r}
fit$analyses %>% str(max.level = 1)
```

This insight will come in handy in just a bit.

## We want lines!

### Start naÃ¯ve.

If you wanted to plot the fitted line for a simple linear model, you'd probably use the `fitted()` or `predict()` function. But when you have fit that model to your multiply-imputed data sets, that just won't work. For example:

```{r, eval = F}
predict(fit)
```

If you try executing that line, you'll get a nasty error message reading:

> Error in UseMethod("predict") : no applicable method for 'predict' applied to an object of class "c('mira', 'matrix')"

Our `fit` object is not a regular fit object. It's an object of class `"mira"` and `"matrix"`, which means it's fancy and temperamental.

```{r}
class(fit)
```

At the time of this writing, the **mice** package does not have a built-in solution to this problem. If you're willing to put in a little work, you can do the job yourself.

### Off label.

Remember how we showed how our `fit$analyses` is a list of all 10 of our individual model fits? Turns out we can leverage that. For example, here's the model summary for the model fit to the seventh imputed data set.

```{r}
fit$analyses[[7]] %>% 
  summary()
```

All we needed to do was use the double-bracket indexing. If you're not up on how to do that, Hadley Wickham has a [famous tweet](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/643381054758363136) on the subject and Jenny Bryan has a [great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MfUCX_KpdE&t=615s&frags=pl%2Cwn) discussing the role of lists within data wrangling. With the double-bracket indexing trick, you can use `fitted()` or `predict()` one model iteration at a time. E.g.,

```{r}
fit$analyses[[1]] %>% 
  fitted() %>% 
  str()
```

Building, here's what that can look like if we use `predict()` for all 10 of our models, bind the individual results, and plot them all at once.

```{r, warning = F}
# define the sequence of predictor values
ses_min <- min(b_small$ses, na.rm = T)
ses_max <- max(b_small$ses, na.rm = T)

ses_length <- 30

nd <- tibble(ses = seq(from = ses_min, to = ses_max, length.out = ses_length))

# use `predict()` for each separate model
rbind(
  predict(fit$analyses[[1]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[2]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[3]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[4]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[5]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[6]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[7]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[8]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[9]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence"),
  predict(fit$analyses[[10]], newdata = nd, interval = "confidence")
) %>%
  # wrangle a bit
  data.frame() %>% 
  bind_cols(
    bind_rows(replicate(10, nd, simplify = FALSE))
    ) %>% 
  mutate(.imp = rep(1:10, each = ses_length)) %>% 
  
  # plot!
  ggplot(aes(x = ses)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, group = .imp),
              alpha = 1/10) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit, group = .imp), 
            size = 1/4) +
  # add the observed data for good measure
  geom_point(data = b_small,
             aes(y = iqv)) +
  ylab("iqv")
```

I kinda like this visualization approach. It has a certain Bayesian flair and it does an okay job displaying the stochasticity built in to the multiple imputation framework. However, this approach is totally off label and will probably get shot down by any self-respecting Reviewer #2. 

Fortunately for us, we have a principled and peer-reviewed solution, instead.

### Level up with Miles.

In his [-@miles2016obtaining] paper, *Obtaining predictions from models fit to multiply imputed data*, [Andrew Miles](https://www.andrewamiles.com/) presented two methods for, well, doing what his title said he'd do. Miles called these two methods *Predict Then Combine* (PC) and *Combine Then Predict* (CP). The CP approach invokes first derivatives in a way I'm not prepared to implement on my own. Fortunately for us, the PC approach just requires a little iteration, a few lines within a grouped `summarise()` lines, and a tiny bit of wrangling. In my world, that's cake. `r emo::ji("cake")`

#### Fist: iteration.

For our first step, we'll use `predict()` again for each of our individual versions of the model. This time, however, we'll use thriftier code and iterate with help from `purrr::map()`.

```{r}
fitted_lines <-
  tibble(.imp = 1:10) %>% 
  mutate(p = map(.imp, ~ predict(fit$analyses[[.]], 
                                 newdata = nd, 
                                 se.fit = TRUE) %>% 
                   data.frame())
         )

# what have we done?
fitted_lines
```

We have a nested tibble where the results of all 10 `predict()` operations are waiting for us in the `p` column and each is conveniently indexed by `.imp`. Note also how we did not request confidence intervals in the output, but we did set `se.fit = TRUE`. We'll be all about those standard errors in just a bit.

Here's how we unnest the results and then augment a little.

```{r}
fitted_lines <- fitted_lines %>% 
  unnest(p) %>% 
  # add in the nd predictor data
  bind_cols(
    bind_rows(replicate(10, nd, simplify = FALSE))
    ) %>% 
  # drop two unneeded columns
  select(-df, -residual.scale)

# now what did we do?
glimpse(fitted_lines)
```

#### Second: equations and the implied code.

In his paper (p. 176), Miles's used *predictions*

> as a blanket term for any value $\hat p$ that can
be calculated by applying some type of transformation $t()$ to the vector of coefficients from a fitted model $(\hat \beta)$.
>
> $$\hat p = t(\hat \beta)$$

In our case, $\hat p$ covers the values in our `fit` column. Well, technically we should refer to those `fit` values as $\hat p_j$, where $j$ is the index for a given imputed data set, $j = 1, \dots, m$, and $m$ is the total number of imputations. In our `fitted_lines` tibble, we have called Miles's $m$ index `.imp`.

Anyway, Miles showed we can compute the pooled point estimate $\bar p$ by

$$\bar p = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \hat p_j,$$

which is a formal way of saying we simply average across the $m$ imputed solutions. Here's that in code.

```{r}
fitted_lines %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>% 
  summarise(fit_bar = mean(fit))
```

Though the expected values are pretty easy to compute, it'll take a little more effort to express the uncertainty around those expectations because we have to account for both within- and between-imputation variance. We can define the within-imputation variance $V_W$ as

$$V_W = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m \widehat{SE}_j^2,$$

which is a formal way of saying we simply average the squared standard errors across the $m$ imputed solutions, for each fitted value. Here's that in code.

```{r}
fitted_lines %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>% 
  summarise(fit_bar = mean(fit),
            v_w     = mean(se.fit^2))
```

We can define the between imputation variance $V_B$ as 

$$V_B = \frac{1}{m - 1} \sum_{j=1}^m (\hat p_j - \bar p_j)^2,$$

where we're no longer quite averaging across the $m$ imputations because our denominator is now the corrected value $(m - 1)$. What can I say? Variances are tricky. Here's the code.

```{r}
# define the total number of imputations
m <- 10

fitted_lines %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>% 
  summarise(fit_bar = mean(fit),
            v_w     = mean(se.fit^2),
            v_b     = sum(fit - fit_bar)^2 / (m - 1))
```

We can define the total variance of the prediction $V_{\bar p}$ as 

$$V_{\bar p} = V_W + V_B \left ( 1 + \frac{1}{m} \right ),$$

where the pooled standard error is just $\sqrt{V_{\bar p}}$. Here are those in code.

```{r}
fitted_lines %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>% 
  summarise(fit_bar = mean(fit),
            v_w     = mean(se.fit^2),
            v_b     = sum(fit - fit_bar)^2 / (m - 1),
            v_p     = v_w + v_b * (1 + (1 / m)),
            se_p    = sqrt(v_p))
```

Now we finally have both $\bar p$ and $V_{\bar p}$ for each desired level of `ses`, we can use the conventional normal-theory approach to compute 95% confidence intervals.

```{r}
# this time we'll save the results
fitted_lines <- fitted_lines %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>% 
  summarise(fit_bar = mean(fit),
            v_w     = mean(se.fit^2),
            v_b     = sum(fit - fit_bar)^2 / (m - 1),
            v_p     = v_w + v_b * (1 + (1 / m)),
            se_p    = sqrt(v_p)) %>% 
  mutate(lwr_p = fit_bar - se_p * 1.96,
         upr_p = fit_bar + se_p * 1.96) 

# what do we have?
glimpse(fitted_lines)
```

#### Third: plot.

Now the hard part is over, we're finally ready to plot.

```{r, warning = F}
fitted_lines %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ses)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lwr_p, ymax = upr_p),
              alpha = 1/2) +
  geom_line(aes(y = fit_bar), 
            size = 1/2) +
  # add the observed data for good measure
  geom_point(data = b_small,
             aes(y = iqv)) +
  ylab("iqv")
```

There it is, friends. We have the pooled fitted line and its pooled 95% confidence interval band from our model fit to multiply-imputed data. Until the day that Stef van Buuren and friends get around to building this functionality into **mice**, our realization in **R** code of Andrew Miles's *Predict Then Combine* (PC) approach has you covered.
