<h2>Hit the pause</h2>
<p>I started this series intending to add semiregular installments. Perhaps I’d add one every other month or so. It turns out I’m just not up to it, right now.</p>
<p>Someone important to me died during this plague. Reading and blogging on this book was and has been a way to connect with them—to honor their life. The experience has been rich and raw and meaningful. I hope that not too far off in the future, I’ll be in a better place to take up this task. Until then, take care of you and, to the extent you can bear, look upon those around you with kindness in your heart.</p>
