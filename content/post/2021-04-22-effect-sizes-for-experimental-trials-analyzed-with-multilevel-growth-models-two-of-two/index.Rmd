adjust the global plotting theme defaults.

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
library(tidyverse)

# adjust the global plotting theme
theme_set(
  theme_linedraw() +
    theme(text = element_text(family = "Times"),
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          strip.text = element_text(margin = margin(b = 3, t = 3)))
)
```

### We need data.

Once again, we use the [tribble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tribble.html) approach to enter the synthetic data Feingold displayed in his Table 1 (p. 46).

```{r}
d <-
  tribble(
    ~id, ~tx, ~t1, ~t2, ~t3, ~t4,
    101, -0.5, 3, 5, 5,  7,
    102, -0.5, 4, 4, 6,  6,
    103, -0.5, 4, 5, 7,  8,
    104, -0.5, 5, 6, 6,  8,
    105, -0.5, 5, 6, 7,  8,
    106, -0.5, 5, 7, 7,  7,
    107, -0.5, 5, 6, 8,  8,
    108, -0.5, 6, 6, 7,  9,
    109, -0.5, 6, 8, 9,  10,
    110, -0.5, 7, 7, 8,  9,
    111,  0.5, 3, 5, 7,  9,
    112,  0.5, 4, 7, 9,  11,
    113,  0.5, 4, 6, 8,  11,
    114,  0.5, 5, 7, 9,  10,
    115,  0.5, 5, 6, 9,  11,
    116,  0.5, 5, 7, 10, 10,
    117,  0.5, 5, 8, 8,  11,
    118,  0.5, 6, 7, 9,  12,
    119,  0.5, 6, 9, 11, 13,
    120,  0.5, 7, 8, 10, 12
  ) %>% 
  mutate(`t4-t1`   = t4 - t1,
         condition = ifelse(tx == -0.5, "control", "treatment"))

# inspect the first six rows
head(d)
```

To reacquaint ourselves with the data, we might make a plot. Last time we plotted a subset of the individual trajectories next to the averages, by treatment group. Here we'll superimpose all the individual-level trajectories atop the group averages.

```{r fig1, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 3.75}
d %>% 
  pivot_longer(t1:t4) %>% 
  mutate(time      = str_extract(name, "\\d") %>% as.double(),
         condition = ifelse(tx < 0, "tx = -0.5 (control)", "tx = 0.5 (treatment)")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value)) +
  stat_smooth(aes(color = condition),
              method = "lm", formula = 'y ~ x',
              se = F, size = 4) +
  geom_line(aes(group = id),
            size = 1/4) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(end = .75, direction = -1, breaks = NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~ condition)
  
```
