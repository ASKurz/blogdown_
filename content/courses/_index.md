For the 2021 fall semester, I am teaching *Statistical Analysis* (PA 652), a graduate level introduction to the Generalized Linear Mixed Model within the Department of Applied Behavior Analysis at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology (https://osf.io/3g8vf/). During my graduate training at the University of Mississippi, I taught five semesters of *General Psychology* (Psy 201) and five semesters of *Meditation in Daily Life* (Psy 405). In my final year on campus at the University of Mississippi, I also offered a semester-long graduate-level workshop, *Introduction to Applied Bayesian Data Analysis Using R*. I sometimes offer private statistics consultations and periodically chime in on Bayesian statistics in the [brms section of the Stan forums](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/c/interfaces/brms/36).
