Every so often, people ask how they might support the work I do with my tutorial [blog posts](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/post/) and [ebooks](https://solomonkurz.netlify.app/bookdown/). Here are some options:

* If you like my material, give it a shout out on Twitter! You can find me there at [https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz](https://twitter.com/SolomonKurz).

* If my material directly helped your scientific work, consider citing them. You can find tips on how to cite blog posts in APA 7 style [here](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples/blog-post-references). As far as my books go, I'm okay with people using either their URLs or their DOI numbers. 

* If you teach a related course, share my work with your students! If my work does make your syllabus, please let me know. I'm curating a list.

* If you're applying for a grant, consider buying some of my time. My [employer](https://www.mirecc.va.gov/visn17/) loves it when we collaborate with other workgroups. Be aware that I'm a clinical psychologist, not a statistician. The closer the applied work is to behavioral health, the better. Over the past few years, the projects I have been involved with have included:
  + behavior therapy trials,
  + program evaluation,
  + longitudinal panel research,
  + experimental neuroscience,
  + basic behavioral science,
  + questionnaire development, and
  + non-clinical [EMA](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091415) research.

* No, I am not taking monetary donations, at this time. If you have graduate students, buy them lunch, instead.
